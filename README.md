The discovery of mysterious SSTV signals originating from Duna was a monumental leap in the search for intelligent life. Deciphering the signals revealed The Ignotum System, a previously undiscovered solar system 3 light years from Kerbin. Having recently mastered interstellar travel and hibernation technologies, the Kerbals were quick to launch an expedition to this new system. The trip ran smoothly, but upon arrival....

…

Alone among the stars, you are the future of the expedition. Rediscover ancient rocketry and flight technologies as you explore a vast, handcrafted solar system. Uncover the secrets behind the SSTV signals and the alien civilization that created them.

Precursors is a planet pack designed to provide a fresh and exciting experience to players. Stranded on a cold and barren world, traverse highly detailed celestial bodies and never-before-seen environments. Each planet and moon has a distinct challenge and appearance; hike across scalding volcanic mountains, maneuver through massive forests, and battle against relentless gravity on your journey across The Ignotum System. Collect thousands of custom science reports and unearth extensive lore in this continuation of the KSP story.

# Author's Note
Hi there! I'm Wpetula. Over the past four years, I've had a wonderful time learning how to engineer custom celestial bodies with the help of the awesome Kerbal Space Program community, especially the Kopernicus Discord group. Thank you everyone for your support! This has been a one-man project, and Precursors would not be what it is today without you.

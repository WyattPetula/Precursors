![Precursors](https://i.imgur.com/YdqtDtg.png)

# OVERVIEW

The discovery of mysterious SSTV signals originating from Duna was a monumental leap in the search for intelligent life. Deciphering the signals revealed the Ignotum System, a previously undiscovered solar system ~3 light years from Kerbin. Having recently mastered interstellar travel and hibernation technologies, the Kerbals were quick to launch an expedition to this new system. The trip ran smoothly, but upon arrival....

…

The last signal from the expedition was years ago. Voyaging across the infinite void, explore a vast, handcrafted solar system and uncover the findings of the lost expedition. Uncover the secrets behind the SSTV signals and the alien civilization that created them.

Precursors - Interstellar Edition is a planet pack designed to provide a fresh and exciting experience to experienced players. Traverse highly detailed celestial bodies and never-before-seen environments. Each planet and moon has a distinct challenge and appearance; hike across scalding volcanic mountains, maneuver through massive forests, and battle against relentless gravity on your journey across The Ignotum System. Collect thousands of custom science reports and unearth extensive lore in this continuation of the KSP story.

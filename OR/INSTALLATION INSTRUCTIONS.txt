1. Download and unzip the Precursors folder from the GitHub repository.
2. Select the internal OR folder, then move or copy it into into the KSP->GameData folder.
3. Install all listed dependencies (and recommendations, if you wish) for Precursors (see the Forum or the GitHub README for the list).
4. (!) If using EVE Volumetrics, remove the clouds.cfg file from KSP->GameData->StockVolumetricClouds and relocate it outside KSP-GameData.
5. (!) If using Parallax, note that Parallax 2.0 is supported, NOT Parallax Continued. The game will still run with Parallax Continued but will lack Precursors content.
6. Start Kerbal Space Program

If everything is installed correctly, a ringed Kerbin-like planet will be visible on the main menu. Enjoy!

  2. Several cloud maps, coverage maps, and type maps derive from or are copies of Blackrack's gorgeous stock volumetric clouds. Several EVE configs also derive from his stock configs.
  3. Precursors's aurora configs derive from jthero3's EVE Volumetric Aurora mod configs.
  4. I use custom PQS Mods by forum users Niako and Lt_Duckweed to enhance terrain quality and create a glowing terrain effect, respectively.
  5. Precursors's Parallax implementation currently uses ParallaxStockTextures. All credit for these textures goes to GamesLinx.

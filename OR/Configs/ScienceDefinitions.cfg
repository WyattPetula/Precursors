    @RESULTS
    {
        default = It appears that the Kerbal upstairs forgot to give this place meaning. Congrats on making it here!
		
		//BIOMES
		
		//Sun
		SolusSrfLanded = This is a feature, I guess. 
		
		//Fracture (GOOD)
		FractureSrfSplashedLavaSeas = You aren't sure how you managed to land in the lava. Best not to think about it too hard.
		FractureSrfLandedLavaSeas = Now you're...under the lava. At the bottom, actually. Why?
		FractureSrfLandedIgneousPlains = Below you, the lava frothes violently. Molten waves lap the broken obsidian shore, melting shards of rock and releasing plumes of poisonous gas.
		FractureSrfLandedTrenches = On either side of you, enormous mountains rise high into the burning red sky. The heat generated within Fracture is so intense that the tectonic activity of the planet is noticeable on the scale of months.
		FractureSrfLandedRocklands = The terrain is very steep and uneven. One wrong move will send you plummeting.
		FractureSrfLandedDarkness = This side of Fracture hasn't seen Solus in millenia. Neither will we, if we stay here.
		FractureSrfLandedTwinCraters = Fracture's twin craters are absolutely massive. No wonder the planet is so hot.
		FractureSrfLandedVolcanicClusters = Streams of lava flow from the rims of the volcanoes. You suspect that there are large concentrations of sulfur nearby the ship.
		FractureSrfLandedSulfurMounds = All this sulfur came from those volcanoes. Ew.
		FractureSrfLandedVallesKerbalis = Lost in a maze of rock and death, you wish you brought a map, or at least a long piece of string to guide you back home.
		FractureSrfSplashedVallesKerbalis = The lava here flows in rivers through the twisting canyons of stone. Maybe the lava's behavior has something to do with Fracture's warped magnetosphere?
		
		//Char (GOOD)
		CharSrfLandedValleys = The obsidian in the valley shimmers in the intense sunlight. Bombarded by endless cosmic rays, the surface is constantly melting and evaporating into space.
		CharSrfLandedValleySlopes = The ground here is broken yet smooth, like shards of glass. The higher you climb above sea level, the more chaotic the terrain becomes.
		CharSrfLandedScorchedPeaks = Without any protection from the interaction between Solus and Fracture, massive magnetic instabilities form at this altitude. Any magnetic materials in Char are expected to behave unpredictably. 
		CharSrfLandedVallesMajoris = There are many steep valleys on this side of the moon. The stress here must be incredibly strong.
		CharSrfLandedSIGNALZONE = STRONG SIGNAL DETECTED NEARBY! FURTHER INVESTIGATION REQUIRED. \n\nThe signal source is located almost exactly on Char's north pole. Fracture looms over the horizon menacingly.
		
		//Echo (GOOD)
		EchoSrfSplashedWaters = The ocean surface is calm. There are no alien fish, just small patches of blue algae and bubbles.
		EchoSrfSplashedPinkAlgaeLake = Pink mush clings to the sides of the ship.
		EchoSrfSplashedHeartLagoon = Green mush clings to the sides of the ship.
		EchoSrfSplashedRivers = The river flows gently downstream from the mountains.
		EchoSrfLandedWaters = As sand settles around your craft, the ocean floor comes into view. Poking out of the sediment are various pieces of twisted metal. They are encased in an organic net-like structure.
		EchoSrfLandedMuddyPlains = Instead of sand, the shores of Echoâ€™s oceans are hidden beneath a deep layer of organic sludge and vegetation. Bleugh.
		EchoSrfLandedForests = You stare at the surrounding trees with a look of curiosity and awe. Despite being on an alien world far from Kerbin, the vegetation looks oddly familiar.
		EchoSrfLandedDenseForests = As time passes, you notice something odd. It feels like you are being watched, yet there is no sign of animal life anywhere.
		EchoSrfLandedMountains = Despite the low temperature and pressure, the trees are enthusiastic to live up here.
		EchoSrfLandedTundra = Despite the freezing winds, vegetation dominates the polar caps.
		EchoSrfLandedDeserts = It is blisteringly hot, and yet, the trees are thriving.
		EchoSrfLandedRivers = The river current isn't terribly strong, even at the bottom.
		EchoSrfLandedCanyon = While the canyon isn't as fabulous as the one on Dres, it is still an incredible sight.
		EchoSrfLandedANOMALY = FAINT SIGNAL DETECTED NEARBY! FURTHER INVESTIGATION REQUIRED. \n\nThe sides of the crater blend in with the natural scenery. At its base, trees grow on bare soil.																																																									//All Rights Reserved, Wyatt Petula (wpetula)
		
		//Vista (GOOD)
		VistaSrfLandedEquatorialRidge = As expected, the terrain is higher than the surrounding land. 
		VistaSrfLandedDivergentRidge = As expected, the terrain is higher than the surrounding land. 
		VistaSrfLandedMare = The ground is deep grey and cold. It's cool to think that there was once lava here.
		VistaSrfLandedCrystalizedMidlands = The ground glitters with minerals.
		VistaSrfLandedQuartzHighlands = The ground glitters with white quartz.
		VistaSrfLandedBridgelands = These unusual peaks stab across the equatorial ridge.
		VistaSrfLandedShardlands = Long ridges of minerals and rock wind across the moon's surface.
		VistaSrfLandedSIGNALZONE = STRONG SIGNAL DETECTED NEARBY! FURTHER INVESTIGATION REQUIRED. \n\nThe source of the signal is located near Vista's north pole. Echo is clearly visible over the horizon.
		
		//Maar (GOOD)
		MaarSrfSplashedMaars = The yellowish muck is ultra dense, repelling the ship out from its depths. 
		MaarSrfSplashedFloodlands = The yellowish muck is ultra dense, repelling the ship out from its depths.
		MaarSrfSplashedGreatHotspot = The yellowish muck is ultra dense, repelling the ship out from its depths - a good thing, considering the name of this place.
		MaarSrfLandedMaars = Inside the crater, the mysterious liquid bubbles and foams.
		MaarSrfLandedCrateredLowlands = Around the craters, the ground is sandy and smooth.
		MaarSrfLandedCrateredHighlands = Around the craters, the ground is rocky.
		MaarSrfLandedRippleZone = The crust is banded and warped, likely due to a major explosion.
		MaarSrfLandedGreatHotspot = The ground is warm, which is generally not a good sign on a vacuum world.
		MaarSrfLandedFloodlands = Dried muck coats the surface in a shimmering crust. Ew.
		
		//Windswept (GOOD)
		WindsweptSrfLandedRedBasins = Red dunes stretch into the distance, and small pebbles litter the ground. There is no sign of water or life.
		WindsweptSrfLandedContinentalSlopes = Long ago, this strip of land was a sandy beach bordering a shallow ocean of water. 
		WindsweptSrfLandedContinents = Strong gusts of wind rock the ship, and dust obscures your view. 
		WindsweptSrfLandedPeaks = The desert extends over the horizon and out of sight. It seems impossible that oceans could have once existed here.
		WindsweptSrfLandedPolarRegions = Despite being near the poles, there is no sign of ice anywhere. Any remaining water must be hidden deep underground.
		WindsweptSrfLandedPlateaus = The sides of the plateau drop sharply out of view. Let's stay away from there, shall we?
		WindsweptSrfLandedRiverlands = The land is in an extreme state of drought. It's hard to believe great rivers once emptied into this valley.
		WindsweptSrfLandedMinorCanyons = The ground drops sharply into the canyon. No river remains.
		WindsweptSrfLandedMajorCanyon = The canyon is remarkably large and perhaps thousands of meters deep. It must be one of the oldest landforms on the planet.
		WindsweptSrfLandedVolcanicCanyon = Instead of water, a mighty river of lava eroded away the rock in this canyon.
		WindsweptSrfLandedAncientVolcanoes = Back when the planet was active, these volcanoes ejected thousands of tons of molten material into the atmosphere.
		WindsweptSrfLandedSIGNALZONE = STRONG SIGNAL DETECTED NEARBY! FURTHER INVESTIGATION REQUIRED. \n\nThe surrounding landscape is just as dead as everything else on this planet. What interest did the signal makers have with this forgotten world?
		
		//Tension (GOOD)
		TensionSrfLandedBasaltRiver = The surface is warped parallel to the equator. Perhaps there was a lava flow here not long ago.
		TensionSrfLandedWarpedBands = As opposed to the equator, the ground warping points toward the poles.
		TensionSrfLandedEquator = Compared to the poles, the warping around the equator is intense. You watch the stars rush across the sky in real time as the moon tries to fling you into space.
		TensionSrfLandedBoundaryZones = The ground is a little warped, but otherwise, the situation is nominal.
		TensionSrfLandedPoles = Well, that wasn't so hard. Are you sure this is the right place?
		TensionSrfLandedSIGNALZONE = STRONG SIGNAL DETECTED NEARBY! FURTHER INVESTIGATION REQUIRED. \n\nIt's clear why someone would land a probe at this location: the surrounding landscape is relatively tame.
		
		//Scourge (GOOD)
		ScourgeSrfSplashedTHEEND = DHFJBFYUGSYUYOUFJHGEAREFJHETHEDJSYEHGREASONGTSJFHUSDGD
		ScourgeSrfLandedTHEEND = WJDHJDWHYHFJBSHETHEYDKHFBEHSUALLDJHBFEJDIEDKJSBNF
		ScourgeSrfLandedPoles = Scourge's massive rings trace around the horizon, and the sky is a mix of pink and cyan.
		ScourgeSrfLandedBoundaryZones = From out beyond the shore, you hear something calling to you. You feel tempted to follow the voice.
		ScourgeSrfLandedBloodlands = The ground is slimy, fuzzy, and very disgusting. This is not somewhere you want to be.
		ScourgeSrfLandedPulsatingHills = Deep rumbles can be heard, and the air itself shakes violently in response.
		ScourgeSrfLandedPeaks = Below you, magma pumps through the mountain range, and small surface eruptions blast nearby.
		ScourgeSrfLandedSinkholes = The liquid inside the sinkholes rises and sinks, almost as though it is breathing.
		ScourgeSrfLandedKraken'sEye = The Kraken's Eye is the most massive volcano ever discovered. It is advised that you stay away from here.
		ScourgeSrfLandedKraken'sMaw = From inside the massive crater, you think you can hear something whispering to you. You are too far away to hear what, though.
		ScourgeSrfLandedKraken'sSnout = The way air is sucked in and out of the twin volcanoes is similar to how an animal breathes.
		ScourgeSrfLandedVolcanoes = Massive chunks of lava and rock are constantly hurled into Scourge's stratosphere. It is best to stay out of the way.
		
		//Siren (GOOD)
		SirenSrfSplashed = Uh oh, looks like the world is broken again :I
		SirenSrfLandedPrimaryImpactCraters = The craters are massive in comparison to the rest of the moon. It's a miracle that this world exists at all.
		SirenSrfLandedCraterRims = Giant spikes of rock jut out from the edge of the craters. We should probably avoid landing on them.
		SirenSrfLandedCrateredSlopes = The ground rises steeply for hundreds of meters.
		SirenSrfLandedShatteredMare = Craters big and small dominate the broken landscape.
		SirenSrfLandedSIGNALZONE = STRONG SIGNAL DETECTED NEARBY! FURTHER INVESTIGATION REQUIRED. \n\nNearby the crater, purple dust can be seen under the regolith. 
		
		//Hydra (GOOD)
		HydraSrfSplashed = Uh oh, looks like the world is broken again :I
		HydraSrfLandedLowlands = You stare in awe at the alien landscape around the ship. The hills are certainly taller than you.
		HydraSrfLandedMounds = While they aren't the plateaus you were hoping to visit, the mounds are still impressive in their own right.
		HydraSrfLandedPlateauSlopes = The lowlands have long faded into the distance, and you aren't even at top of the plateau.
		HydraSrfLandedPlateaus = Sitting on top of the world, you can't help but feel like the king of this foreign land.
		HydraSrfLandedSIGNALZONE = STRONG SIGNAL DETECTED NEARBY! FURTHER INVESTIGATION REQUIRED. \n\nThe signal is coming from near Hydra's north pole. Scourge sits at a safe distance in the sky.
		
		//Cetus (GOOD) 
		CetusSrfSplashed = Uh oh, looks like the world is broken again :I
		CetusSrfLandedDrumHeads = The ground is a stone throw away from falling apart and entering orbit around the core of the mysterious object.
		CetusSrfLandedSisyphusSlopes = This is not be a nice place to take a hike.
		CetusSrfLandedDrumBase = Nothing about this moon makes any sense. Science!
		
		//Frontier (GOOD)
		FrontierSrfLandedOxidizedFlats = The ground is flaky, pink, and probably doesn't taste as good as Minmus.
		FrontierSrfLandedSnowyPlains = The ship sinks a few inches into the snow before stopping.
		FrontierSrfLandedFractureZones = Boulders are strewn across the jagged peaks of rock, and a fierce wind rocks the ship.
		FrontierSrfLandedJaggedMountains = The air is thin, and the sky is a deep grey. Frontier's atmosphere fades quickly with altitude.
		FrontierSrfLandedGreatRedFlat = Behold, the largest flat on Frontier. There is an enormous concentration of iron here.
		FrontierSrfLandedLesserRedFlat = Behold, the second smallest (but still impressive) flat on Frontier. There is a lot of iron on the ground.
		FrontierSrfLandedColossalPeaks = The air is extremely thin, and you can see the blackness of space above you.
		FrontierSrfLandedExpeditionCrashSite = Where there was once flaming wreckage is now only an endless expanse of snow.
		FrontierSrfLandedCryovolcanoes = The cryovolcanoes on Frontier are much more massive than the ones on Vall.
		FrontierSrfLandedRingofIce = Plumes of crystalized ice erupt from geysers surrounding the central cryovolcanoes.
		FrontierSrfLandedStressFracture = Frontier's ice has been packed solid over thousands of years. The event that created this fracture must have been quite devastating.
		FrontierSrfLandedSIGNALZONE = STRONG SIGNAL DETECTED NEARBY. FURTHER INVESTIGATION REQUIRED. \n\nJudging by the ground color, the region surrounding the signal is by far the most iron-saturated section of the Great Red Flat.
		
		//Scar (GOOD)
		ScarSrfLandedHotspots = The ships sinks several centimeters before slowing to a stop. Phew.
		ScarSrfLandedMuddyBasins = The ground is slightly soft, like wet clay. 
		ScarSrfLandedPlateLowlands = The ground is a chalky brown color. It is certainly a nice change of color from the Mun's endless gray.
		ScarSrfLandedPlateHighlands = The ground is dark gray and rocky. You can see the brown sections of the moon slope towards the rifts and basins.
		ScarSrfLandedPeaks = You are high above the rest of the moon. This is the best spot for a scenic view of Frontier on the horizon.
		ScarSrfLandedSIGNALZONE = STRONG SIGNAL DETECTED NEARBY. FURTHER INVESTIGATION REQUIRED. \n\nThe signal source is positioned at Scar's north pole. Frontier glimmers white and pink against the stars.
		ScarSrfLandedRidge = This ridge is absolutely massive. The ground trembles slightly beneath the ship, and you hear a muffled roaring sound.
		ScarSrfLandedRifts = Material from one plate is being dragged down toward Scar's core, forming this rift. Judging by the sheer number of rifts on this moon, it is clear that Scar is generating an enormous amount of interior energy.
		ScarSrfLandedGigaRifts = It's difficult to tell whether this is a tectonic rift or a canyon formed by past lava flow. Whichever it is, maybe being here is not a good idea.
		ScarSrfLandedSurvivingCraters = Most of the craters on Scar fill themselves in or are sucked into the mantle, so these craters must be new.
		ScarSrfLandedMunBasin = The terrain here is reminiscent of the Mun's. The ground is unusually cold in comparison to the rest of Scar.
		
		//Rage (GREAT)
		RageSrfLanded = Haha gas giant go brrr
		
		//Abyss (GOOD)
		AbyssSrfSplashedCraterShallows = The water is turbulent and green. \n\n*Vomits*
		AbyssSrfSplashedOceanicPlains = Was there really no better place to land?
		AbyssSrfSplashedDepths = My faith in your landing skills has been voided. No refunds.
		AbyssSrfLandedReefs = This region of ocean consists of small "reefs" and atolls.
		AbyssSrfLandedCraterIsland = WOOOO, BULLSEYE!--I mean, this is the center of the volcano.
		AbyssSrfLandedInnerCraterRing = These island rings are enormous, and we aren't even on the edge of the volcano caldera.
		AbyssSrfLandedOuterCraterRing = The outer islands act as protection against the surrounding ocean.
		AbyssSrfLandedCraterShallows = The water isn't deep here.
		AbyssSrfLandedOceanicPlains = The ship groans under the enormous pressure. These parts were built for space, not the ocean.
		AbyssSrfLandedDepths = It is very dark, and the creaks of the ship are deafeningly loud. 
		AbyssSrfSplashedSIGNALZONE = FAINT SIGNAL DETECTED BELOW! FURTHER INVESTIGATION REQUIRED. \n\nYour instruments are just barely capable of detecting the signal. Translating it requires you to get closer to the source.
		AbyssSrfLandedSIGNALZONE = STRONG SIGNAL DETECTED NEARBY! FURTHER INVESTIGATION REQUIRED. \n\nYou are very far below sea level. You hope that you have a plan to return to the surface.
		
		//Icebound (GOOD)
		IceboundSrfLandedBlueIceFields = Massive ice spikes tower above the ship in all directions. 
		IceboundSrfLandedIceSpikes = Despite physics, we somehow landed on a spike.
		IceboundSrfLandedTundralSlopes = The frequency of spikes increases the deeper into the basin you travel.
		IceboundSrfLandedGlacialDepressions = Hills, rocks...nothing unusual for an ice world.
		IceboundSrfLandedSnowlands = There are no ice spikes here.
		IceboundSrfLandedSIGNALZONE = STRONG SIGNAL DETECTED NEARBY! FURTHER INVESTIGATION REQUIRED. \n\nThe signal source is located on the boundary between land dominated by ice spikes and land dominated by just ice.
		
		//Silence (GOOD)
		SilenceSrfSplashedFrigidWaters = Water rocks your ship. It is shallow, deep blue, and very cold.
		SilenceSrfLandedFrigidWaters = There is not a lot of light down here. You start to shiver.
		SilenceSrfLandedRockyPlains = Hey, there are trees here! It's freezing cold, and yet, there is life.
		SilenceSrfLandedGlacialPlains = Despite the presence of glaciers and ruins, the ground is amazingly flat. The buildings here are less massive than the ones in the distance.
		SilenceSrfLandedGlaciers = A few small cracks form in the ice from the weight the ship, but otherwise, the ground appears to be stable.
		SilenceSrfLandedAlphaColony = STRONG SIGNAL DETECTED NEARBY! FURTHER INVESTIGATION REQUIRED. \n\nThe ground is covered with vegetation, and trees dominate the landscape. They do not seem to mind the frigid temperatures.
		SilenceSrfLandedBetaColony = FAINT SIGNAL DETECTED NEARBY! FURTHER INVESTIGATION REQUIRED. \n\nThe ground is spongy and wet beneath the ship. It pulses weakly as though it is trying to communicate with you.
		SilenceSrfLandedPolarCaps = Not even the low freezing point of the water here is enough to combat the cold.
		SilenceSrfLandedSIGNALZONE = FAINT SIGNAL DETECTED NEARBY! FURTHER INVESTIGATION REQUIRED. \n\nThe surrounding landscape is unremarkable. What could a signal be doing here?
		
		The_Magic_BoulderSrfLanded = You've found The Magic Boulder! Enjoy the magic. Soak in the radiation. Reap the tremendous SCIENCE.
		
		//Night (GOOD)
		NightSrfLandedLowlands = You can't see anything. The light of the ship is not enough to pierce the darkness.
		NightSrfLandedLumps = The moons of Rage dance above you.
		NightSrfLandedSIGNALZONE = STRONG SIGNAL DETECTED NEARBY! FURTHER INVESTIGATION REQUIRED. \n\nAs far as you can tell, the signal is coming from near Night's north pole.
		
		//Serenity (GOOD)
		SerenitySrfLanded = So, there is a bottom. You probably shouldn't have seen this. Good luck with returning to Frontier.
		SerenitySrfSplashed = In theory, there should be a bottom to this ocean. \nIn theory.
		
		//Tranquility (GOOD)
		TranquilitySrfSplashed = Uh...yes...underground ocean?
		TranquilitySrfLandedSupersonicEquator = There are many things you don't understand about this place. One thing is for certain, though: it isn't for you.
		TranquilitySrfLandedSonicBands = The wind speeds are Kerbin-shattering. Why the ship hasn't been torn apart is a mystery.
		TranquilitySrfLandedSubsonicPoles = The wind speeds are high but not lethal. The landscape would argue otherwise, though. Broken piles of rock and rubble are scattered everywhere.
		TranquilitySrfLandedSIGNALZONE = FAINT SIGNAL DETECTED NEARBY! FURTHER INVESTIGATION REQUIRED. \n\nIt isn't hard to imagine why the signal is so faint or why there isn't any debris anywhere.
		
		//Odyssey (GOOD)
		OdysseySrfLandedVoraciousMaw = WHY ARE WE IN THE MOUTH OF THIS--? WHY???
		OdysseySrfLandedMawRim = Let's put your expert flying skills to good use: get us out of here, please.
		OdysseySrfLandedFurrowedEye = Uh, hey: I think it sees us.
		OdysseySrfLandedSobbingEye = Awww...this place looks so sad.
		OdysseySrfLandedScrape = *Horrified face*\n...What the heck happened here?
		OdysseySrfLandedSIGNALZONE = FAINT SIGNAL DETECTED NEARBY! FURTHER INVESTIGATION REQUIRED. \n\nThe surrounding landscape is horrifically scringly. Why would there be a signal here?
		OdysseySrfLandedTrench = AUGH! Look at the size of this canyon!
		OdysseySrfLandedScraggles = The scraggles are very scringly.
		OdysseySrfLandedScraggleStalks = The scringly scraggle stalks are very spindly.
		OdysseySrfLandedScraggleFollicles = Follicles like...hair? Uh, WHAT?
		OdysseySrfLandedEpidermis = Skin...made of rock. Hopefully. How wonderful!
		
		//SPACE
		
		//Sun (GOOD)
		SolusFlyingLow = You think Fracture is hot? Think again.
		SolusFlyingHigh = You take a quick glance at the Sun and instantly regret your decision.
		SolusInSpaceLow = Radiation levels outside are approaching lethal levels.
		SolusInSpaceHigh = We are on a journey far from home. 
		
		//Fracture (GOOD)
		FractureFlyingLow = It's hard to see now that the window has melted.
		FractureFlyingHigh = Can we please leave? I'm plenty warm right now.
		FractureInSpaceLow = Wow, that atmosphere looks angry.
		FractureInSpaceHigh = The planet glows brilliantly against the pitch black of space.
		
		//Char
		CharInSpaceLow = Look at the broken surface...this place has been through heck.
		CharInSpaceHigh = The moon's dark valleys stand out against Fracture's menacing red sky.
		
		//Echo (GOOD)
		EchoFlyingLow = You watch as several bird-like creatures fly by. Life!
		EchoFlyingHigh = The surface is a mirror image of Kerbin's. Oh, to be home....
		EchoInSpaceLow = A blue atmosphere...you know what that means!
		EchoInSpaceHigh = There it is: the living planet. It is such a welcome sight.
		
		//Vista (GOOD)
		VistaInSpaceLow = The surface is so battered that individual craters are no longer visible.
	    VistaInSpaceHigh = The equatorial ridge is clearly visible in contrast to the surrounding terrain.
		
		//Maar (GOOD)
		MaarInSpaceLow = The craters are brimming with a thick, chunky liquid that is most definitely not soup.
		MaarInSpaceHigh = Craters dominate the surface as a result of millions of years of heavy bombardment.
		
		//Windswept (GOOD)
		WindsweptFlyingLow = Even near sea level, the air is ultra thin.
		WindsweptFlyingHigh = The surface shows signs of weathering and erosion, yet there is no water in sight.
		WindsweptInSpaceLow = The sky is choked with dirty yellow dust. Without it, the atmosphere would be nearly invisible.
		WindsweptInSpaceHigh = Although cold and desolate, Windswept looks quite beautiful from high up.
		
		//Tension (GOOD)
		TensionInSpaceLow = So much spinning...I think I'm going to be sick.
		TensionInSpaceHigh = It's hard to tell how fast the ship is orbiting. 
		
		//Scourge (GOOD)
		ScourgeFlyingLow = The journey through Scourge's atmosphere is turbulent and unpleasant. It feels like the air itself is trying to drag the ship down.
		ScourgeFlyingHigh = Even high up, the pink haze is dense and corrosive. It stains the windows and makes piloting very difficult.
		ScourgeInSpaceLow = The planet looms just below you. You have been advised not to venture any closer.
		ScourgeInSpaceHigh = It's ironic how something so beautiful can be so deceiving. 
		
		//Siren (GOOD)
		SirenInSpaceLow = Huge peaks and hills reach out toward your ship. You hope your orbit is uninterrupted.
		SirenInSpaceHigh = Siren is constantly being bombarded by small ring particles. It's craters all the way down.
		
		//Hydra (GOOD)
		HydraInSpaceLow = Now THIS is space exploration!
		HydraInSpaceHigh = Even from far away, Hydra's deformities are extremely apparent.
		
		//Cetus (GOOD0
		CetusInSpaceLow = The orbit tracker isn't equipped to handle this.
		CetusInSpaceHigh = HOLY KRAKEN! It IS a drum! WOOOO YEAHHH--
		
		//Frontier (GOOD)
		FrontierFlyingLow = It is very cold outside, and snow flies past the window. Frontier is a very different world than Kerbin.
		FrontierFlyingHigh = The atmosphere thins quickly with altitude. Considering the heightened gravity, this is good news for our space program.
		FrontierInSpaceLow = The planet's surface is partially obscured by a snowy haze.
		FrontierInSpaceHigh = Frontier our second home. Cold as it may be, it sure is beautiful.
		
		//Scar (GOOD)
		ScarInSpaceLow = Funny, I can't see many craters down there. The surface must be very young.
		ScarInSpaceHigh = Scar looks like the Mun but brown, and covered in canyons, and...okay, nevermind.
		
		//Rage (GOOD)
		RageFlyingLow = It is very, very, very windy. The pressure is increasing towards the point of no return.
		RageFlyingHigh = It is very, very windy. What did you expect?
		RageInSpaceLow = This is a comfortable altitude. Do you hear me?
		RageInSpaceHigh = Even from far away, the violent motion of Rage's clouds is clearly visible.
		
		//Abyss (GOOD)
		AbyssFlyingLow = The sky is stained lime green from the chlorine.
		AbyssFlyingHigh = Mmmmm, look at all that murky water. Nothing says "swimming" like deadly chemicals.
		AbyssInSpaceLow = Green usually means life. Not this time.
		AbyssInSpaceHigh = Abyss is almost a true ocean world. Almost.
		
		//Icebound (GOOD)
		IceboundInSpaceLow = Careful, those ice pillars are tall.
		IceboundInSpaceHigh = You can confirm: the surface is definitely spiky.
		
		//Silence (GOOD)
		SilenceFlyingLow = The surface is concerningly deserted.
		SilenceFlyingHigh = You can just make out the green tops of trees far below.
		SilenceInSpaceLow = You feel very lonely. Below you, the frozen land looks empty.
		SilenceInSpaceHigh = Silence reminds you of home. A very cold, very dead version of home.
		
		The_Magic_BoulderInSpaceLow = Glowing green streaks dominate the surface. You pray that they're just for decoration.
		The_Magic_BoulderInSpaceHigh = Hey, wait...isn't this the thing that killed some of our friends on Kerbin? WHY ARE WE NEAR IT???
		
		//Night (GOOD)
		NightInSpaceLow = The window is filled with complete darkness.
		NightInSpaceHigh = It is too dark to make any meaningful observations.
		
		//Serenity (GOOD)
		SerenityFlyingLow = It is clear now that yes, Serenity has an ocean. It is not clear, however, if that ocean has an end.
		SerenityFlyingHigh = This place would make for a good cocktail. So many pretty colors!
		SerenityInSpaceLow = We are literally flying on the edge of the edge.
		SerenityInSpaceHigh = Serenity is the edge of everything we know. It is the boundary between the Ignotum System, interstellar space, and our old home.
		
		//Tranquility (GOOD)
		TranquilityFlyingLow = Down below, you can see glowing specks of something.
		TranquilityFlyingHigh = It's hard to see through the blue haze, and hurricane winds, and...well, you just can't see.
		TranquilityInSpaceLow = You are having trouble telling whether Tranquility is just another ice giant or something unique.
		TranquilityInSpaceHigh = You wonder why the colors of the ice giants are so different.

		FractureSrfLandedDarkness = Even in the dark, I can feel the heat of the molten side of the planet.
		FractureSrfLandedTwinCraters = There are two craters. I think. Let me count again....
		FractureSrfLandedVolcanicClusters = Volcanoes are not Kerbal safe. This whole planet is not Kerbal safe. Let's go home, please.

		FractureSrfLandedVallesKerbalis = HOLY KRAKEN HELP BURNINGGGG--
		FractureSrfSplashedVallesKerbalis = This is not okay.
		
		//Char
		CharSrfLandedValleys = The ground is glossy and smooth, including the massive spikes everywhere.
		CharSrfLandedValleySlopes = Interestingly, the spikes at this altitude are smaller than the ones below.
		CharSrfLandedScorchedPeaks = It's hard to believe that in a few centuries, this moon isn't going to be here.
